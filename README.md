This Python program performs text preprocessing on a list of news articles related to SDG 4 (Quality Education). It cleans the text and analyzes word frequency.

📌 Short Explanation of the Program

The program takes three news articles and applies the following text preprocessing steps:

1. Cleaning the Text

Converts text to lowercase

Removes numbers, punctuation, and special characters

Keeps only alphabets



2. Tokenization

Splits the cleaned text into individual words



3. Stopword Removal

Removes common English words (like “the”, “is”, “in”, “to”) that don't add meaning



4. Stemming

Converts words to their root form

Example: "education" → "educ", "students" → "student"



5. Word Frequency Count

Counts how many times each stemmed word appears




Finally, it prints the intermediate results (cleaned text, tokens, stopword-removed words, stemmed words) and the word frequency output.

✅ Purpose

This program demonstrates a simple approach to text preprocessing, useful in NLP, data analysis, and machine learning, especially when analyzing news articles for SDG 4.
